¬¬¬Customer loyalty software 

Customer loyalty software is an essential article for running successful reward programs.
It is a program run by a company that offers benefits to frequent customers 
The most common loyalty program models allow customers to accumulate points through sales or straightforward actions on your store. Customers earn points on every purchase they make, which can then be redeemed for a reward to encourage them to make a repeat purchase.
For an ideal upholding of a loyalty scheme, these systems track customer activities with a unique identifier. Shop retailers can track customer rewards using the consumer’s phone number or email address, allowing them to access key data in the process. They can view what and when you buy, analyse your trends and create advertising that’s uniquely curated to you.
An ideal workflow of the software would be to simply collect the particular user’s activity and record the same to analyse and provide benefits to the frequent customers.


Features for a Customer Loyalty Software based on activities on a retail website:

1. Collect logs of user product view activities.

2. Record the purchase made by users.

3. Analyse the data stored to:
	 . Recognize regular customers
	 . Analyse repeated trends
	 . Pin Point trending products
	 . Assign slabs of value for 'loyalty' per user
	 . Increment and decrement value for 'interest' in each product

4. 	 . Assign coupons and discounts for each user's 'loyalty' value in slabs 
 	 . Allow users to avail them on trending products (products with high 'interest').

5. Keep track of use of coupons and discounts by user and assign limited coupons in given time frame.
	(eg. max use of 1 coupon per day)

Our code is a component for Customer Loyalty Rewardal System. It needs to run on an already existing website giving us data. 
Input - daily database. 
Output - users and their rewards.
If you purchase today, you can claim your reward only tomorrow, since only at EOD , our component will allocate you rewards. Therefore, if a user makes 2 purchases in same day, he will not be able to avail rewards of his first purchase on his second purchase on the same day.
